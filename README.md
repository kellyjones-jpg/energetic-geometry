# Energetic Geometry: The Art and Power of Agrivoltaics (In Progress...)

An interactive web-based visualization that explores agrivoltaics with abstract forms while emphasizing accessibility and longevity.

Drawing inspiration from Suprematism and Op Art, the project transforms complex environmental data from the [InSPIRE Agrivoltaics Map](https://openei.org/wiki/InSPIRE/Agrivoltaics_Map) into dynamic geometric forms and optical illusions using p5.js.

Visually, the work rejects photorealism in favor of generative abstraction, using layered grids, geometric shapes, and evolving forms to reflect the complex relationships between solar infrastructure, agriculture, and biodiversity.
