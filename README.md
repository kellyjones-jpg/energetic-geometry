# Energetic Geometry

How might generative systems expand our understanding of climate solutions and ultimately reimagine the way we visualize sustainability itself?

Energetic Geometry is an interactive, web-based agrivoltaics visualization platform built with scalability, accessibility, and longevity at its core. Drawing inspiration from Suprematism and Op Art, the project transforms complex environmental data into dynamic geometric forms and optical illusions using p5.js.

Based on the InSPIRE Agrivoltaics Map, each of the 600 project sites is represented as a unique geometric entity whose size, color, shape, texture, and movement are algorithmically generated from site-specific attributes including: Agrivoltaics Activities, System Size (MWdc), Site Size (Acres), Year Installed, PV Technology, Type of Array, Habitat Types, Crop Type, and Animal Type.

Users can explore the piece through intuitive zoom and pan controlsâ€”viewing the entire system as a cohesive abstract composition or diving into individual sites. Clicking a site reveals a contextual tooltip containing detailed site information. This interaction transforms the user from a passive observer to an active participant within the system.

Visually, the work abandons photorealism in favor of a generative abstraction that mirrors the complexity of living ecosystems. Through layered grids, flowing patterns, and evolving forms, it mimics the interplay of solar infrastructure, agriculture, and biodiversity without literal representation.
