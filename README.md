# Energetic Geometry: The Art and Power of Agrivoltaics

An interactive web-based visualization that explores agrivoltaics through abstract representation while emphasizing accessibility and longevity.

Drawing inspiration from Suprematism and Op Art, the project uses p5.js, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to transform complex environmental data from the [InSPIRE Agrivoltaics Map](https://openei.org/wiki/InSPIRE/Agrivoltaics_Map) into dynamic geometric compositions and optical illusions.

Visually, the work rejects photorealism in favor of generative abstraction, using layered grids, geometric shapes, and evolving patterns to reflect the complex relationships between solar infrastructure, agriculture, and biodiversity.
