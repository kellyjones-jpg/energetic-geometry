# Energetic Geometry (In Progress...)

An interactive web-based visualization platform that reimagines agrivoltaics through a lens of scalability, accessibility, and longevity. Drawing inspiration from Suprematism and Op Art, the project transforms complex environmental data into dynamic geometric forms and optical illusions using p5.js.

Based on the [InSPIRE Agrivoltaics Map](https://openei.org/wiki/InSPIRE/Agrivoltaics_Map), each of the 604 project sites is represented as a unique geometric entity whose size, color, shape, texture, and movement are algorithmically generated from site-specific attributes such as Agrivoltaics Activities, System Size (MWdc), Site Size (Acres), Year Installed, PV Technology, Array Type, Habitat Types, Crop Type, and Animal Type.

Users can explore the piece through intuitive zoom and pan controls—viewing the entire system as a cohesive abstract composition or diving into individual sites. A timeline slider enables users to filter sites by their installation year, providing a dynamic view of how agrivoltaics have expanded and evolved over time. Clicking on a site reveals a contextual tooltip with detailed information, inviting users to explore the data through both visual intuition and factual depth.

Visually, the work departs from photorealism in favor of generative abstraction—layered grids, flowing patterns, and evolving forms mirror the complex interplay of solar infrastructure, agriculture, and biodiversity.

How might generative systems deepen our understanding of climate solutions—and transform how we visualize sustainability itself?
