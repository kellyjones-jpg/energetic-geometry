    <h2 class="mt-4">About</h2>
     <p><em>Energetic Geometry</em> is a generative visualization platform built with p5.js, a creative coding library that brings data to life through visual expression. It transforms complex agrivoltaic data into abstract, algorithmic compositions designed for accessibility and inclusivity, inviting everyone to explore the intersection of energy and agriculture. Blending environmental science, computational design, and contemporary art, the project uses visual storytelling to reveal how energy and nature can coexist in meaningful and surprising ways.</p>

        <h3>Artistic Foundations</h3>
        <p>The visual logic is shaped by influences from abstraction, systems-based art, and perceptual design. Suprematist works by Kazimir Malevich and El Lissitzky inform its geometric clarity and spatial structure, while Sol LeWitt's conceptual art frames the generative code as a system for executing ideas.</p>
        <p>Dynamic, rule-based visuals reflect the procedural methods of Casey Reas, Ben Fry, and Vera Molnár, who translate data into visual form. Optical strategies from Bridget Riley and Victor Vasarely amplify motion and ecological rhythm, while Marius Watz contributes a sense of generative flow and systemic emergence.</p>
        <p>Helvetica, chosen in line with Robert Bringhurst's principles of clarity and restraint, provides a neutral typographic foundation that supports the visual complexity without distraction.</p>
        <h3>What is Agrivoltaics?</h3>
        <p>Agrivoltaics is the practice of co-locating solar panels with agricultural activity—whether that means planting crops beneath solar arrays, restoring habitat, or rotating livestock through a photovoltaic (PV) field. This hybrid approach to land use challenges the old either/or: farmland or solar farm. Instead, it invites new models of coexistence, transformation, and resilience.</p>
        <h3>Data Source</h3>
        <p>This project draws on publicly available data from the Innovative Solar Practices Integrated with Rural Economies and Ecosystems (InSPIRE) <a class="hyperlink" href="https://openei.org/wiki/InSPIRE/Agrivoltaics_Map" aria-label="InSPIRE Agrivoltaics Map">Agrivoltaics Map</a>, a project led by the U.S. Department of Energy and managed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. InSPIRE supports the growth of agrivoltaics by providing open data, field research, and tools that promote sustainable solar-agriculture practices. Their dataset forms the foundation for the visual translations in this project.</p>

     <h3>A New Kind of Visualization</h3>
        <p><em>Energetic Geometry</em> reimagines what scientific visualization can be. Through a fusion of abstraction, data, and creative code, it interprets agrivoltaics not as a static technical solution, but as a dynamic system of relationships between land, energy, and life.</p>
        <p>Instead of relying on charts or static graphics, the project invites viewers to pause, explore, and interpret. Here, generative art becomes more than aesthetic expression; it functions as a cognitive tool for perceiving complexity while encouraging deeper reflection on the future of sustainable land use.</p>
