        <p><em>Energetic Geometry</em> is a generative visualization platform that transforms agrivoltaic datasets into abstract, algorithmic compositions. Agrivoltaics—the practice of co-locating solar panels with agriculture or habitat—is a hybrid system that challenges traditional land use models by fostering energy production, ecological health, and agricultural productivity in shared space.
        <h3>Artistic Foundations</h3>
        <p>The visual logic draws from Suprematism and Op Art, two influential 20th-century art movements.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p><strong>Suprematism</strong>, founded by Kazimir Malevich, distills meaning into bold geometric forms and clear spatial hierarchies—ideal for expressing the modularity of solar infrastructure and the clarity of land use patterns.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Op Art</strong>, with artists like Bridget Riley and Victor Vasarely, explores visual tension, motion, and optical illusion. Its perceptual dynamism mirrors the shifting flows of sunlight, crops, and ecological cycles that define agrivoltaic environments.</p></li>
            </ul>
        <h3>What is Agrivoltaics?</h3>
        <p>Agrivoltaics is the practice of co-locating solar panels with agricultural activity—whether that means planting crops beneath solar arrays, restoring habitat, or rotating livestock through a photovoltaic (PV) field. This hybrid approach to land use challenges the old either/or: farmland or solar farm. Instead, it invites new models of coexistence, transformation, and resilience.</p>
        <h3>Data Source</h3>
        <p>This project draws on publicly available data from the Innovative Solar Practices Integrated with Rural Economies and Ecosystems (InSPIRE) <a class="hyperlink" href="https://openei.org/wiki/InSPIRE/Agrivoltaics_Map" aria-label="InSPIRE Agrivoltaics Map">Agrivoltaics Map</a>, a project led by the U.S. Department of Energy and managed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. InSPIRE supports the growth of agrivoltaics by providing open data, field research, and tools that promote sustainable solar-agriculture practices. Their dataset forms the foundation for the visual translations in this project.</p>

     <h3>A New Kind of Visualization</h3>
        <p>At its core, <em>Energetic Geometry</em> is about rethinking what scientific visualization can look like. By combining abstraction, data, and code, the project offers a way to see agrivoltaics not just as a technical solution—but as an evolving system of relationships between land, energy, and life.</p>
        <p>Rather than overwhelming the viewer with charts or models, it invites them to pause, explore, and interpret—engaging both analytical insight and visual intuition. In doing so, it positions generative art not simply as an aesthetic layer, but as a cognitive tool for understanding our environmental future.</p>
