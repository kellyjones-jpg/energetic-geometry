        <p>Energetic Geometry is a generative visualization platform that transforms agrivoltaic datasets into abstract, algorithmic compositions. Agrivoltaics—the practice of co-locating solar panels with agriculture or habitat—is a hybrid system that challenges traditional land use models by fostering energy production, ecological health, and agricultural productivity in shared space.
        <p>To visualize this complexity, Energetic Geometry blends environmental science, computational design, and contemporary art. Drawing from data provided by the InSPIRE project’s Agrivoltaics Map, each visual composition encodes real-world variables—such as photovoltaic (PV) technology, crop types, and system size—into geometric forms and generative systems. The result is a visual language uniquely suited to agrivoltaics: layered, modular, dynamic, and alive with ecological rhythm.</p>
        <p>Rather than depicting systems literally, the project embraces structured abstraction to reveal the hidden patterns and relationships within the data—turning information into rhythm, movement, and meaning.</p>
        <h3>Artistic Foundations</h3>
        <p>The visual logic draws from Suprematism and Op Art, two influential 20th-century art movements.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Suprematism</strong>, founded by Kazimir Malevich, distills meaning into bold geometric forms and clear spatial hierarchies—ideal for expressing the modularity of solar infrastructure and the clarity of land use patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Op Art</strong>, with artists like Bridget Riley and Victor Vasarely, explores visual tension, motion, and optical illusion. Its perceptual dynamism mirrors the shifting flows of sunlight, crops, and ecological cycles that define agrivoltaic environments.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>These movements shape both the aesthetic and conceptual approach of Energetic Geometry, allowing environmental data to unfold in perceptual and spatial form.</p>
        <h3>Why Agrivoltaics?</h3>
        <p>Agrivoltaics is the practice of co-locating solar panels with agricultural activity—whether that means planting crops beneath solar arrays, restoring habitat, or rotating livestock through a PV field. This hybrid approach to land use challenges the old either/or: farmland or solar farm. Instead, it invites new models of coexistence, transformation, and resilience.</p>
        <p>But visualizing these systems isn't simple. They are layered, modular, and dynamic. Energetic Geometry responds to this complexity by developing a visual language that matches the hybrid nature of agrivoltaics—neither fully scientific nor purely artistic, but a generative fusion of both.</p>
        <h3>Data Source</h3>
        <p>This project draws on publicly available data from the Innovative Solar Practices Integrated with Rural Economies and Ecosystems (InSPIRE) <a class="hyperlink" href="https://openei.org/wiki/InSPIRE/Agrivoltaics_Map" aria-label="InSPIRE Agrivoltaics Map">Agrivoltaics Map</a>, a project led by the U.S. Department of Energy and managed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. InSPIRE supports the growth of agrivoltaics by providing open data, field research, and tools that promote sustainable solar-agriculture practices. Their dataset forms the foundation for the visual translations in this project.</p>
        <h3>A New Kind of Visualization</h3>
        <p>At its heart, Energetic Geometry is about rethinking what scientific visualization can look like. By combining abstraction, data, and code, the project offers a way to see agrivoltaics not just as a technical solution—but as an evolving system of relationships between land, energy, and life.</p>
        <p>Rather than overwhelming the viewer with charts or models, it invites them to pause, explore, and interpret—engaging both analytical insight and visual intuition. In doing so, it positions generative art not simply as an aesthetic layer, but as a cognitive tool for understanding our environmental future.</p>
