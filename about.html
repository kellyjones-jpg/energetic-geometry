    <h2 class="mt-4">About</h2>
     <p class="lead"><em>Energetic Geometry: The Art and Power of Agrivoltaics</em> is a generative visualization platform built with p5.js that transforms complex agrivoltaic data into accessible, abstract compositions.</p> 
      <p>By blending environmental science, computational design, and art, it reveals how energy and agriculture coexist through dynamic visual storytelling that embraces inclusivity.</p>

        <h3>Artistic Foundations</h3>
        <p>The visual logic is shaped by influences from abstraction, systems-based art, and perceptual design. Suprematist works by Kazimir Malevich and El Lissitzky inform its geometric clarity and spatial structure, while Sol LeWitt's conceptual art frames the generative code as a system for executing ideas.</p>
        <p>Dynamic, rule-based visuals reflect the procedural methods of Casey Reas, Ben Fry, and Vera Molnár, who translate data into visual form. Optical strategies from Bridget Riley and Victor Vasarely amplify motion and ecological rhythm, while Marius Watz contributes a sense of generative flow and systemic emergence.</p>
        <p>Helvetica, chosen in line with Robert Bringhurst's principles of clarity and restraint, provides a neutral typographic foundation that supports the visual complexity without distraction.</p>
        <h3>What is Agrivoltaics?</h3>
        <p>Agrivoltaics is the practice of co-locating solar panels with agricultural activity—whether that means planting crops beneath solar arrays, restoring habitat, or rotating livestock through a photovoltaic (PV) field. This hybrid approach to land use challenges the old either/or: farmland or solar farm. Instead, it invites new models of coexistence, transformation, and resilience.</p>
        <h3>Data Source</h3>
        <p>This project draws on publicly available data from the Innovative Solar Practices Integrated with Rural Economies and Ecosystems (InSPIRE) <a class="hyperlink" href="https://openei.org/wiki/InSPIRE/Agrivoltaics_Map" aria-label="InSPIRE Agrivoltaics Map">Agrivoltaics Map</a>, a project led by the U.S. Department of Energy and managed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. InSPIRE supports the growth of agrivoltaics by providing open data, field research, and tools that promote sustainable solar-agriculture practices. Their dataset forms the foundation for the visual translations in this project.</p>
     <h3>A New Kind of Visualization</h3>
        <p><em>Energetic Geometry</em> reimagines how complex ideas can be expressed through visual design. By merging abstraction, data, and creative code, it interprets agrivoltaics not as a static technical solution, but as a dynamic system of relationships between land, energy, and life.</p>
        <p>Instead of relying on charts or models, the project invites viewers to pause, explore, and interpret. Here, generative art becomes more than aesthetic expression; it functions as a meaningful tool for perceiving complexity while encouraging deeper reflection on the future of sustainable land use.</p>
